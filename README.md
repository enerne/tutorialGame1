# tutorialGame1

A very basic little space game I made while following a youtube tutorial by Brian Advent (link: https://youtu.be/cJy61bOqQpg)
The player can't even be moved at this point, but can shoot directly ahead with a tap.

This has only been tested on IPhone SE (Second Generation) emulator so idk how it'll look on any other emulator or a real phone.
